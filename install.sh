# One install method per host. On Debian and Ubuntu (dpkg and apt-get present):
# - tetron-wm installed by apt: the release .deb upgrades it, through apt. When
#   the release has no .deb the script changes nothing and exits with status 3,
#   so it never writes over a file the package owns.
# - a raw copy (not from a package): upgraded in place, as before.
# - neither: the release .deb is installed when the release has one, else the
#   raw binary.
# Everywhere else (other Linux, macOS) the raw binary, as before.
