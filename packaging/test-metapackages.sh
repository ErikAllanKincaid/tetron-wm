# Install the given debs together in a clean container WITH Recommends (as
# `apt install tetron-wm-desktop` does by default), then, for each metapackage
# among them (Architecture all), check from its own control fields that:
# - every Recommends is installed (for an `a | b` alternative, one of them);
# - no Suggests was installed, not even through a Recommends of a Recommends.
#   A Suggests such as openssh-server would start a network service.
# mkdeb's own install test uses --no-install-recommends, so it covers neither
# (WMDEB-007, WMDEB-009).
# Usage: packaging/test-metapackages.sh [-i IMAGE] tetron-wm.deb tetron-wm-desktop.deb [tetron-wm-extras.deb]
