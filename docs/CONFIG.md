# tetron-wm configuration reference

Configuration lives at `~/.config/tetron-wm/config.toml`. A ready-to-copy file with every key at its default and a short note per key is `config.example.toml` in the repository root; this document is the full reference. Every option has a default, so the file is optional: with no config at all, the defaults below apply. You only add keys you want to change. A ready-to-edit, fully-commented template is `config.example.toml` in the repo root.

Out of the box, snapping and window shadows are off and the default theme is midnight.

## Option reference

Each row is the TOML key, its type, the default, and what it does.

(`light` is a deprecated alias for `pastoral`.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Relative paths resolve against the config dir; also overridable via `$TETRON_WM_THEMES_DIR`. A theme file is a flat table of palette fields (`desktop_bg`, `window_bg`, `title_focus`, `title_blur`, `title_fg`, `border`, `shadow`, `ctrl_fg`, `close_fg`, `menubar_bg`, `dock_bg`, `text`, `dim`, `accent`, `active_bg`, plus the optional `success`, `error`, `accent_fg`, `icon_fg`) → `#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa` / named color (see [Theme file keys](#theme-file-keys)); optional `name` and `base` (built-in to inherit unset fields from), and an optional `[vt16]` table pinning roles to 16-colour palette indices (`desktop_bg = 6`; 0-7 for backgrounds) for the bare Linux console, where the 16-colour version is otherwise derived from the theme's own hues, and an optional `[ansi]` table setting the 16 colours hosted apps see. Create one with `tetron-wm theme --dump <name>`; list all names with `tetron-wm theme --list`. Low-contrast themes are warned about in the debug log, never rejected.                                                                                  |

Unset follows the theme's `window_bg`. Applies live to running apps (no app-server restart) when the app server supports it (protocol v4+). Settings → Terminal edits it with presets, hex entry and a Preview / Save / Revert flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The main memory cost of a busy window; lower it on small machines. Read when a window opens, so a change applies to new windows without restarting the app server. |
| `truecolor`                  | bool                              | auto-detect                           | Force 24-bit color on/off. Unset = detect from known truecolor terminals + `COLORTERM`. Set `true` when the terminal supports truecolor but omits `COLORTERM` (common with `TERM=xterm-256color`), else subtle themes quantize to the 256-color cube (nord → teal/navy). `TETRON_WM_TRUECOLOR=1/0` env overrides this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `wallpaper`                  | string                            | `"default"`                           | Desktop wallpaper, a picture drawn as colored cells via `chafa` (so it works on any terminal incl. a kmscon console) and composited behind the windows. `"default"` (or empty) is the active theme's own picture: the theme file's `wallpaper` key, else the image next to it with the same name (`dawn.toml` + `dawn.jpg`), else the one built into the binary (midnight, gruvbox, pastoral and windows each have one; any other theme shows midnight's). `"black"` and a `"#rrggbb"` colour make a flat desktop with no `chafa`; `"none"` is the theme's own `desktop_bg`. Anything else is your own pick and stays when you change theme: an absolute path, a `~`-path, or a name looked up in `~/.config/tetron-wm/themes/`, then the config root, then the old `wallpapers/` folder. Surrounding quotes, `file://` URLs and a leading `$HOME` are accepted, so a pasted path works. Below 256 colors `default` is the theme's `desktop_bg` (a picture turns to noise there), while a file you chose is still drawn. A missing file shows the theme's picture (logged, and noted under the row in Settings → Appearance); a missing `chafa` → solid desktop. For a plain desktop on purpose use `wallpaper = "none"` or `wallpaper_enabled = false`. In Settings, clearing the field writes `default` back. `TETRON_WM_WALLPAPER=<value>` env overrides this. |
| `wallpaper_enabled`          | bool                              | `true`                                | Master on/off for the wallpaper. When `false`, the desktop is solid even if `wallpaper` names an image. (Settings → Appearance toggles this.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `colors`                     | string                            | `"auto"`                              | Color depth: `"auto"` uses what the terminal reports (16 on the bare Linux console, black and white with `NO_COLOR` or a vt100-class `TERM`), or force `"mono"` (black and white), `"16"`, `"256"` or `"truecolor"`. Settings → Appearance → Colors switches it live, no reattach. `TETRON_WM_COLORS` set for a client wins over this. |
| `cast_device`                | string                            | `""`                                  | The Chromecast for the right-click **Cast to Chromecast** on video, audio and image files: a device name or IP, as `catt -d` takes it. Empty uses catt's own default device (`catt set_default`). Needs [catt](https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt) installed; the item is hidden without it. The cast runs in a window (catt serves the file from this machine until playback ends), so the Chromecast must be on the same LAN, and closing the window stops it. |
| `image_viewer`               | string                            | `"auto"`                              | How the built-in image viewer draws. `"auto"`: Kitty graphics when the terminal supports them (kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm), never on a bare Linux console; otherwise the image as colored cells via `chafa` (works everywhere, kmscon and the bare console included), or built-in half blocks when chafa is missing. `"graphics"` uses Kitty graphics whenever the terminal reports them; `"cells"` always draws cells. In the viewer `m` cycles the three for that window. |
| `default_project_dir`        | string                            | home (`~`)                            | Directory the working-directory picker opens at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Defaults: `cpu`, `mem`, `bluetooth` = `info`, the rest `auto`. A CPU or memory reading of 90% or more shows on the bar anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

A value is one command line or an ordered list; the first whose program is on `$PATH` wins. Prefix a command with `hold:` to run it through `sh -c` and keep the window open until Enter (for one-shot output). An empty list removes the row. Defaults: cpu `htop`, else `top` (even if not detected); mem `hold:free -h`, `hold:vm_stat`; battery `jolt`, `hold:upower -i $(upower -e \| grep -m1 -i bat)`, `hold:pmset -g batt`; bluetooth `bluetuith`, `bluetoothctl`, `hold:blueutil --paired`; network `wlctl`, `nmtui`, `iwctl`, `hold:ip -br addr`, `hold:networksetup -listallhardwareports`, `hold:ifconfig`; volume `wiremix` (with `-s extracompat` on the ascii icon style), `pulsemixer`, `ncpamixer`, `alsamixer`. When no volume mixer is installed, Linux shows a `Get wiremix (Store)` row instead. |

## App entries

`apps`, `launcher`, and `desktop_pins` are arrays of tables. Each entry's fields:

| Field          | Type           | Meaning                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | string         | Label shown in the titlebar and taskbar.                                  |
| `command`      | string         | Executable to run (or a `@builtin` like `@files`, `@store`).              |
| `args`         | list of string | Arguments for the command.                                                |
| `category`     | string         | Grouping shown in the launcher menu.                                      |
| `requires_cwd` | bool           | Prompt for a working directory before launching.                          |
| `cwd`          | string         | Fixed working directory to start in.                                      |
| `cli`          | bool           | Wrap a CLI tool so its window does not exit instantly (gives it a shell). |
| `warn`         | string         | Confirmation text shown before launching (for destructive tools).         |

Example:

```toml
## Add to config.toml
[[apps]]
name = "Shell"
command = "bash"
args = []

[[launcher]]
name = "htop"
command = "htop"
cli = true
category = "System"
```

## Keyboard and mouse (not config, built in)

These behaviors are fixed in tetron-wm and do not need configuration:

- Select text in a terminal window by left-drag (highlighted).
- Paste the primary selection: middle-click, three-finger tap, or `Shift+Insert`.
- Clipboard: `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the selection (and to the host via OSC 52), `Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes it.
- Scrollback: mouse wheel, or `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown`.
- Hold `Shift` to force terminal selection/paste even over an app that is grabbing the mouse.
- Right-click a desktop icon or a file in Files (or leader `.`): Open (with no `[default_apps]` handler, video and audio play in the window with `mpv --vo=tct` / `--no-video`), Open with… (apps for the file type, fresh and other editors for text, casttui for video and audio when installed), Set as wallpaper, Extract here and List contents for archives (tar, zip, 7z, rar, gz/xz/bz2/zst; also decrypts `.gpg` and `.age`, and opens AES zips with 7-Zip when installed), Compress… (`.7z`, `.zip`, `.tar.gz`) and Encrypt… (`.7z` AES-256 with hidden file names, AES `.zip`, `.tar.gz.age`, `.tar.gz.gpg`; the tool asks for the password in a window, so it never reaches the command line, disk or log; local folders only; the original stays; `.7z` and `.zip` do not keep Unix owners and only partly keep permissions, the `.tar.gz` formats keep them), Cast to Chromecast (video, audio and images, with catt), Copy path, Open terminal here, Get Info, Send to… (scp to a saved Systems entry, in a window so prompts work), Rename, Move to Trash. On a plain Linux console, View full screen (images, fbi or fim) and Play full screen (video, `mpv --vo=drm` or `cvlc --vout fb`) hand the screen over and come back on quit. Under kmscon, Play full screen and View full screen (images with fbi or fim, PDFs with fbgs) work with the full screen helper (`install-tetron-wm-suite.sh --fullscreen`, `--fullscreen-vt N`, default tty9): a systemd service running `tetron-wm fullscreen-waiter` as your user in its own login session on a spare VT. The client sends it the file path over an owner-only socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; it switches there through logind (no root), runs `mpv --vo=drm` with hardened options (or fbi, fim or fbgs, chosen by the helper from the kind of file, never from the request; the route follows what the machine has: video uses mpv over DRM, else cvlc on the framebuffer; images use fbi, fim, then mpv over DRM with n / p, arrows, + - 0 and q; PDFs use fbgs with gs, else pdftoppm pages through mpv; a machine with no `/dev/fb0`, as with the NVIDIA driver, simply takes the DRM routes, and an item is offered only when a route exists. The same choice applies on a plain console), and switches back when the program exits. The viewer's `f` key uses it too. The empty desktop offers New Folder, Open terminal here and Clean Up. Right-click a window's title bar for Minimize, Maximize, Move, Rename and Close.
- PDFs open in the same viewer, one page at a time (needs poppler: `pdftoppm`); `n` / `p` turn pages. Open with… also offers the text in a pager (`pdftotext`), `tdf` and `timg` when installed, and View full screen uses `fbgs` on a plain console.
- Image viewer (open an image from the file manager or desktop): `+` / `-` or the mouse wheel zoom, `0` fits, arrows or a left-button drag pan when zoomed, `n` / `p` (and Left / Right at fit, Space, PageDown / PageUp) step through the images in the folder, `m` switches graphics / cells, `i` toggles the info line, `f` shows it full screen with fbi or fim (plain Linux console only, not kmscon or a GUI terminal; `q` in fbi returns), `Esc` or `q` closes.

## Leader keys

Press the leader (`ctrl+space`), release it, then the key. Rebind any action under `[keys]`; setting one replaces its default keys. A key is a single character or `space`, `enter`, `tab`, `backtab` (Shift+Tab), `esc`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `backspace`.

| Action        | Default keys | Does                                                                   |

| `volume`      | `=`          | volume popover: Left/Right level, m mute, Down + Enter opens the mixer |
| `close`       | `esc`        | close focused window (asks first for app windows)                      |

| `store`       | `S`          | app store                                                              |
| `settings`    | `,`          | settings                                                               |

| `select`      | `x`, `y`     | select mode: drag selects text even in mouse-capturing apps (one-shot) |

## Recipes

Copy-paste scenarios. `##` lines explain, `#>` lines are commands to run in a shell, `#$` lines are settings for `config.toml`. Run `tetron-wm --help` for every command.

### Sessions

```
## Start (or attach to) the default session.
tetron-wm
## List sessions: attached | detached | recoverable | stale.
tetron-wm ls
## Attach to a detached session (never starts one).
tetron-wm attach example-session-name
## Take over a session another terminal or ssh login is attached to.
tetron-wm attach -d
## A separate workspace side by side with the default one.
tetron-wm -s work
## Any command can target a session.
tetron-wm -s work launch htop
## Show the session name on the launcher button.
launcher_label = "@session"
## Leave with apps running: leader q, or launcher > Detach. Stop everything:
tetron-wm kill
```

### After editing config.toml

```
## Restart the UI only; apps keep running.
tetron-wm reload
## terminal_bg / terminal_fg and clipboard shims are read by the app host: stop everything and relaunch.
tetron-wm kill
tetron-wm
```

### Themes and colors

```
## List built-in and file themes.
tetron-wm theme --list
## Switch the theme.
tetron-wm theme nord
## Write a built-in theme to ~/.config/tetron-wm/themes/gruvbox.toml to edit, then keep theme = "gruvbox".
tetron-wm theme --dump gruvbox
## More themes: nord, dracula, dawn, newmoon and contrast (white on black, no picture)
## come with the suite installer (--themes, on by default) and land in themes/.
## A theme X.toml shows X.jpg (or png, webp) from the same folder while
## wallpaper = "default", or the file its own `wallpaper = "..."` key names.
## Light desktop, dark terminals.
theme = "pastoral"
terminal_bg = "#000000"
terminal_fg = "#e6e6e6"
## Washed-out nord/dracula over ssh or a terminal that hides truecolor support.
truecolor = true

## Same, for one run only.
TETRON_WM_TRUECOLOR=1 tetron-wm

## Fewer colors. Auto-detected: the kernel console (TERM=linux) gets 16 colors,
## NO_COLOR or a vt100-class TERM gets black and white. The theme adapts by role,
## so the desktop, windows and the selection stay distinct; mono draws the
## selection in reverse video.
## TETRON_WM_COLORS is always honoured. On the bare Linux console 256 and
## truecolor are accepted but the kernel reduces them to its own 16 colors.
TETRON_WM_COLORS=16 tetron-wm
TETRON_WM_COLORS=mono tetron-wm
```


#### Theme file keys

A picture of where each key is used, with a step-by-step walkthrough: [tetron-wm_theming_guide.html](tetron-wm_theming_guide.html).

A theme is `<config dir>/themes/<name>.toml`: a flat table of colors (`#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, or a color name). Start from `tetron-wm theme --dump <built-in>`. Any key left out is inherited (see each row), so a theme can be three lines. An invalid value is logged and the inherited one is kept.

| Key | Colors | If unset |
|---|---|---|
| `desktop_bg` | the desktop behind the windows (and the plain desktop when `wallpaper = "none"`) | `base` theme |
| `window_bg` | window body and terminal background | `base` |
| `title_focus`, `title_blur` | title bar of the focused / other windows | `base` |
| `title_fg` | title bar text | `base` |
| `border` | window frame | `base` |
| `shadow` | window shadow (alpha sets its strength; `#00000000` is none) | `base` |
| `ctrl_fg` | the minimize / maximize glyphs | `base` |
| `close_fg` | the close glyph and destructive-button fill | `base` |
| `menubar_bg`, `dock_bg` | top bar, taskbar | `base` |
| `text` | body, menu and terminal text | `base` |
| `dim` | secondary text, hints | `base` |
| `accent` | highlighted labels, panel button text, fill of the "+" button | `base` |
| `active_bg` | selection: menu highlight, panel buttons, focused taskbar item | `base` |
| `success` | status text that is good: installed, verified, switched on, update available | dark green, or a deeper green when `window_bg` is light |
| `error` | status text that is bad: errors, low-contrast warning, kill | `close_fg` |
| `accent_fg` | text drawn on a fill of `accent` (the "+" button) | white, or black when white would be unreadable on `accent` |
| `icon_fg` | desktop icon labels over a wallpaper picture (on the `desktop_scrim`) | white |

Other keys: `name`, `base` (a built-in to inherit from, default `midnight`), `appearance` (`dark` or `light`, informational), `wallpaper` (the theme's picture, see Wallpaper below).

`success`, `error`, `accent_fg` and `icon_fg` follow the colors in the same file, not the `base` theme's, so a light file based on midnight does not keep midnight's dark-theme green.

**`[ansi]`** sets the 16 colors hosted apps see when they use the palette (`ls --color`, `htop`, `git`), named `black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white` and the same with a `bright_` prefix. Set any subset; the rest keep the default palette. An app that asks the terminal for its colors (OSC 4) gets the same answers. Apps already running are repainted when the theme is switched.

```toml
[ansi]
red = "#ff5555"
bright_black = "#6272a4"
```

**`[vt16]`** is for the bare Linux console, which has 16 colors and only 8 backgrounds. By default the 16-color look is derived from the theme. To pin a role, give it a palette index (0 black, 1 red, 2 green, 3 brown, 4 blue, 5 magenta, 6 cyan, 7 grey, 8-15 the bright forms). Backgrounds can only use 0-7 (8-15 fold to 0-7). The roles are the 18 color keys above (all but `shadow`): `desktop_bg window_bg title_focus title_blur title_fg border ctrl_fg close_fg menubar_bg dock_bg text dim accent active_bg success error accent_fg icon_fg`. Grey themes need this: derivation only keeps a color that has a clear hue, so a grey `active_bg` becomes teal unless pinned.

```toml
[vt16]
active_bg = 7     # light grey selection
success = 10
```

Run `tetron-wm theme <name>` to try a theme; the file is read again within a second of saving, then re-select the theme to apply it. Colors that are hard to read are warned about in `~/tetron-wm-debug.log`, never rejected.

### Wallpaper and desktop

```
## Needs chafa. Drop an image in, then reference it by name.
mkdir -p ~/.config/tetron-wm/themes && cp photo.jpg ~/.config/tetron-wm/themes/
wallpaper = "photo.jpg"
## Follow the theme again (each theme brings its own picture).
wallpaper = "default"
## A flat desktop: black, any colour, or the theme's own desktop colour.
wallpaper = "black"
wallpaper = "#004040"
wallpaper = "none"
## No wallpaper at all.
wallpaper_enabled = false
## Icon labels straight on the image, no backdrop.
desktop_scrim = "none"
## Try a wallpaper without editing the config.
TETRON_WM_WALLPAPER=~/Pictures/other.png tetron-wm reload
```

### Windows and tiling

```
## Add to config.toml
## Three columns on an ultrawide, auto-arranged, with a one-cell gutter.
auto_tile = true
grid_rows = 1
grid_cols = 3
tile_gap = 1

## Tile everything now.
tetron-wm tile

## Snap windows to screen edges when dragged.
snapping_enabled = true
## Open every app maximized.
launch_maximized = true
```

### Apps, launcher and desktop

```
## Open an app in the running desktop.
tetron-wm launch htop
tetron-wm launch nvim ~/code/notes.md

## Add to config.toml

## Start a shell at every launch.
[[apps]]
name = "Shell"
command = "bash"

## A project editor that asks for its directory, and a one-shot CLI whose output stays visible.
[[launcher]]
name = "Neovim in project"
command = "nvim"
requires_cwd = true

[[launcher]]
name = "Disk usage"
command = "df"
args = ["-h"]
cli = true

## A destructive entry asks first.
[[launcher]]
name = "Wipe cache"
command = "rm"
args = ["-rf", "/home/you/.cache/thing"]
warn = "This deletes the cache. Continue?"

## Pin the file manager on the desktop.
[[desktop_pins]]
name = "Files"
command = "@files"

## Open files with these programs (this table replaces the built-in map: list every role you use).
[default_apps]
text = "hx"
image = "@image"
directory = "@navigate"
video = "mpv"

## Extra programs in the right-click "Open with…" menu (always listed, after the detected ones).
[open_with]
video = ["casttui", "vlc --fullscreen"]
audio = ["casttui"]
```

### Keys

```
## Change the leader chord (needs reload). Avoid keys terminals use (ctrl+c, ctrl+d, ctrl+z).
leader = "ctrl+b"
## Launcher on "a" only, screensaver on "Z".
[keys]
launcher = "a"
screensaver = "Z"
```

### Clipboard

```
## Keep history in memory only, never on disk.
clipboard_persist = false
## Do not record while a password manager is focused.
clipboard_ignore_apps = ["keepassxc", "bitwarden"]
## Expire unpinned entries after a day.
clipboard_ttl_secs = 86400
## Neovim over ssh with no display: use the shims.
clipboard_shims = "on"
clipboard_fake_display = true
```

```
## Browse and manage the history from the shell.
tetron-wm clip list
tetron-wm clip pin 3
tetron-wm clip copy "some text"
```

### Remote server that must stay up

```
## No Suspend / Reboot / Power off anywhere.
power_menu = false
## Or change how they run, trying each command in order.
[power_commands]
poweroff = ["doas poweroff", "sudo poweroff"]
Hide Suspend.
suspend = []
```

### Status bar

```
## Add to config.toml
## Put battery and wifi always on the bar, CPU in the (i) menu.
[tray_placement]
battery = "bar"
wifi = "bar"
cpu = "info"

## Prefer btop for the CPU popover, remove the memory row.
[tray_tools]
cpu = ["btop", "htop"]
mem = []
```

### Screenshots, screensaver, web

```
## Save a PNG of the whole screen (needs an attached client).
tetron-wm screenshot ~/Pictures/desk.png
#$ screenshot_dir = "/home/you/shots"
## Cover the screen now; any key wakes it.
tetron-wm screensaver on clock
tetron-wm screensaver list
#$ screensaver = "clock"
## Text browsers launched with no URL open this page.
#$ web_home = "https://wiki.archlinux.org"
```

### Updates and the assistant

```
## Add to config.toml
## Track the dev channel (built from source).
update_branch = "dev"
## Use hermes instead of opencode, floating instead of docked.
assistant_command = "hermes"
assistant_mode = "window"
## Inspect what happened: the in-app Logs viewer, or
tail -n 50 ~/tetron-wm-debug.log
```

## Notes

- Changes take effect on the next tetron-wm launch, or after `tetron-wm reload` (Settings can change a subset live).
- `config.toml` is yours. Saving from the app (a Settings change, a pin, the theme) rewrites only the keys that changed: your comments, key order, commented-out blocks and unknown keys stay, and a hand edit to any other key is not reverted even while tetron-wm is running (run `tetron-wm reload` to make it take effect). Nothing is written when nothing changed. Two limits: a comment written directly above a key goes with that key if the key is removed, and when a whole `[[launcher]]`, `[[apps]]` or `[[desktop_pins]]` list changes, comments inside that list are not kept.
- The first time the file is rewritten in a session the old copy is saved as `config.toml.bak`. A file with a syntax error is never overwritten: tetron-wm logs the error (see the Logs viewer), runs on defaults, and saves again once the file parses.
- App-managed data is not in `config.toml`: desktop icon positions and recent working directories live in `~/.local/share/tetron-wm/state.toml` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME` aware). Old `recent_dirs` and `desktop_positions` keys are moved there once and removed from `config.toml`.
- The live Settings UI exposes snapping, snap threshold, grid rows/cols, gap, auto-tile, launch-maximized, natural scroll, shadows, theme, wallpaper on/off, wallpaper file, icon-label scrim, icon style, desktop icons, clipboard (including entry expiry and max item size), terminal colors (presets, hex, preview), assistant, and updates; the remaining keys are file-only or app-managed.
