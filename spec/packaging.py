    2. `theme_dir` from config.toml when set, else `<config dir>/themes`

    resolves against the directory the theme came from. The 4 built-in

class SuiteScriptSizes(Requirement):
    """REQUIREMENT-ID: WMINST-002

    Depends on WMINST-001 and WMDEB-005; carries out WMDEB-008 and the plan's
    WMINST-003 (other systems), since both replace the same hand-written
    lists. `install-tetron-wm-suite.sh`:

    - Asks every user the size: minimal (tetron-wm only), desktop (the
      default, preselected) or extras; `--size` answers it, `-y` takes
      desktop, `--no-extras` means minimal, `--extras` keeps the default.
    - Reads the apps from `assets/suite-apps.txt` (the checkout's copy when
      run from one, else fetched from the branch), never from lists of its
      own. A size installs its lines and the smaller sizes' lines; gui
      lines only with a desktop session; services lines only after their
      own question (default no).
    - On a Debian or Ubuntu host where tetron-wm is the apt package and the
      release has the size's metapackage, installs that metapackage from the
      release (checked against its .sha256) with apt, so apt tracks the set.
      Otherwise (tetron-wm not from the package, or no metapackage in the
      release) it installs the same apps one by one with the package
      manager. A metapackage is never installed next to a raw tetron-wm,
      since it would add a second copy.
    - On a dpkg host where tetron-wm is a raw copy and the release has the
      tetron-wm .deb, offers to convert it (default no; `--convert` answers
      yes): removes the raw copy, then installs the package.
    - Installs the script-only apps of the size (fresh, uv where not
      packaged, catt, casttui, the symbols Nerd Font, and the helper scripts
      when tetron-wm is not the deb), and calls install.sh with its own
      dependency step skipped.
    - Downloads the themes listed in `themes/` on the branch (GitHub
      contents API) into `~/.local/share/tetron-wm/themes`, falling back to
      the built-in list when the listing fails; never overwrites a file.
    - Skips gpm on a Linux machine without a mouse device
      (/dev/input/mice): Debian's gpm fails to configure there and leaves a
      broken package (gpm stays a desktop Recommends; the suite installer
      guards it). One by one it is left out; through the
      metapackage it is excluded with `gpm-` in the same apt command. Systems > Add Remote
      installs gpm on a remote only when it has a mouse device too (over
      ssh the mouse comes from the local terminal, not gpm).
    - Records `size` and `method` (deb or raw) in `suite-state`.
    - `--dry-run` prints the size, method and every package it would
      install. Release URL and tag can be overridden (tests).
